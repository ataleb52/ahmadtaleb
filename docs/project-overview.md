# Ahmad Taleb Landing Page

## Project Overview

A single-page, immersive landing site that reflects Ahmad Taleb's personality, work ethic, and brand. The goal is to engage high-context visitors (startups, execs, internal operators) who are frustrated by bloated processes and looking for someone who can bring clarity, momentum, and real solutions.

## Project Goals

* Establish Ahmad as a sharp, trustworthy, and no-nonsense problem solver
* Visually and interactively reflect his systems thinking, strategic insight, and maker mindset
* Create emotional resonance through sardonic humor, honesty, and quiet confidence
* Provide just enough interaction to be memorable without overwhelming or flashy

## Target Audience

* Startup founders and internal operators with high autonomy
* Execs tired of endless pitch decks, misalignment, or delivery delays
* Builders and decision-makers who value fast, honest, and capable problem solvers


## Deliverables

* Fully responsive landing page (desktop + mobile)
* All components scoped as React components
* Optimized load performance via Vite build
* Clean developer handoff documentation
