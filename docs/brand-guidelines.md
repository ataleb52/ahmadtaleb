# Brand Guidelines

This document outlines the visual design, tone, and brand identity for Ahmad Taleb's landing page.

## Brand Positioning

Ahmad's brand should be positioned as:
- The problem solver people call when normal routes have failed
- The anti-agency: no fluff, just effective outcomes
- A systems thinker with a builder's hands

## Visual Identity

### Core Visual Concept: "The Workshop Blueprint"

The visual identity should evoke the feeling of:
- A back-alley workshop that delivers better results than the big showroom
- A systems map on a chalkboard: scribbled, messy, but undeniably accurate
- A lighthouse: not for vibes, but because someone has to see the rocks
- A blunt instrument in the right hands

### Color Palette

- **Primary Colors:**
  - Slate/charcoal (primary background)
  - Off-white (primary text)
  - Blueprint blue OR deep amber/rust (accent color)

- **Secondary Colors:**
  - Dark wood tones
  - Chalk white
  - Grid paper blue

### Typography

- **Heading Font:** Functional, slightly brutalist sans-serif
  - Options: Space Grotesk, IBM Plex Sans, Inter
  - Use for headlines and key statements
  - Bold weight for contrast and impact

- **Body Font:** Clean, efficient, readable
  - Options: Inter, IBM Plex Sans
  - Prioritize readability on all devices

### Visual Elements

- **Textures:**
  - Woodgrain for workbench sections
  - Blueprint paper background
  - Subtle graph paper patterns
  - Chalk-like or pencil-drawn elements

- **Interactive Elements:**
  - Tool-inspired controls and buttons
  - Physical/tactile interactions (slides, opens, expands)
  - Blueprint-style annotations

- **System Elements:**
  - Node graphs and connections
  - Flow diagrams with intentional hand-drawn quality
  - Symbols that convey systems thinking

## Motion & Interaction

- **Motion Principles:**
  - Subtle, intentional, never flashy
  - Tactile quality, mimicking physical objects
  - Purpose-driven: enhance understanding, not decoration

- **Animations:**
  - Opening/closing motions (like a toolbox or workbench)
  - Reveal animations (like blueprints or schematics unfolding)
  - Connection animations (showing relationships between elements)

- **Transitions:**
  - Smooth but with slight mechanical quality
  - Not slick or corporate
  - Consistent with the workshop metaphor

## Tone of Voice

### Writing Style

- **Direct and concise:** No unnecessary words
- **Dry wit:** Humor comes from honesty and insight, not jokes
- **Technical but accessible:** Complex ideas made clear
- **Quietly confident:** No need to shout or overstate

### Key Phrases & Tone Examples

- "I solve real problems. The kind most people avoid."
- "No pitch decks required."
- "If you want pretty slides, I'm not your guy. If you want traction—keep reading."
- "I don't need 6 weeks to 'scope' a strategy deck."
- "I bring order to chaos—without pretending it's easy."
- "I figure it out"
- "I have a do first ask forgiveness later attitude. I make mistakes quickly and clean them up even quicker. I hustle my way through problems until a solution is found. When I don’t know something, I figure it out. I’m never afraid to ask for help but make sure I do my homework first. I take the box, use the ideas inside of it and then tear it apart to find better ones on the outside. I make things happen."

### Content Rules

1. **No corporate jargon** - Speak plainly and directly
2. **No hyperbole** - Results speak for themselves
3. **No performative empathy** - Show understanding through solutions
4. **Respect the reader's intelligence** - Don't oversimplify
5. **Be candid about complexity** - Don't pretend hard things are easy
